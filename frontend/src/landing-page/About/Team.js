            Md Sadique founded <strong>StockNest</strong> in 2025 as a passion
            project to explore and understand stock market technologies more
            deeply. Inspired by platforms like Zerodha, StockNest is built for
            learning and experimentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform is focused on integrating live stock market APIs,
            simulating trading features, and helping developers understand how
            such systems work under the hood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built entirely from scratch using modern web technologies, StockNest
            reflects Sadique's dedication to learning full-stack development
            through real-world challenges.
          </p>

            When not coding, he enjoys sharing knowledge, exploring financial
            systems, and occasionally diving into open-source contributions.
